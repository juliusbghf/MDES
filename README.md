# Lego-Baustein-Ruestungszeit-Optimierungs-Software-Dingsbums (LBROSD) 
Im Rahmen des Moduls "Discrete-event Simulation and Organization Methods" ist diese Software zur Optimierung der zeitlichen Organisation von Ruestprozessen entstanden. Diese Seite dient als Dokumentation dieser Software. Ab hier dann auf Englisch.

## Software Description

The **LBROSR** is a software for optimizing the sequence of set-up processes for one machine and constraint worker-resources. The goal is to find the set-up-process-schedule with the lowest time. The machine can produce three types of Lego-Bricks and each Brick or Product has its own unique set-up process. The software consists of three pages: This page, an **Initialisation** Page and a **Results** Page. On the Page **Initialisation**, you can visualize the process-data and choose the production order of the three different bricks. On the **Results**-Page there are different graphs and tables of the calculated results, that can also be downloaded for further use. Explanations can be found on each page.

The software is completely written in Python and uses the package **Pyomo** for the optimization. The website is programmed with **Streamlit**. Because the software is completely open source and the tool is accessible via a standard browser (even accessible from mobile), it is a great solution for small and medium enterprises that have limited financial resources and dont want to pay licenses for commercial software. Also it is easily expandable with further features.
